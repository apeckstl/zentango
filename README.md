## Inspiration
For **DemonHacks 2020 Hack-The-Arts Challenge**. Giving people the ability to be create art during the monotony of life, especially during these trying times.

## What it does
You draw portions of a [zentangle](https://mymodernmet.com/zentangle-art/) using the HTML Canvas and associated tools. The images are then combined to create the final (downloadable) product.

## How we built it
We used JavaScript to build the drawing tool, and used HTML/CSS to style the page.

## Challenges we ran into
Our original idea was to make Zentango a collaborative application. We wanted groups of friends to be able to draw individual parts of a creation, so that the combined product would be a community effort. However, as we built the basic drawing tool, we realized we didn't have enough time to implement this idea.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We couldn't find a library or API that would give us a flexible enough drawing tool. We tried a few things, and in the end, decided to write the JavaScript ourselves. We're proud that our tool works well with a clean UI.

## What we learned
- A lot about HTML canvases! In order to get a nice template for a circle-based zentangle, we had to learn how to clip sections of canvas, arrange elements, and scale shapes. The finished product requires a lot of manual calculation for the individual shapes, which we'd eventually like to figure out how to generate automatically.

## What's next for Zentango
- **Collaboration mode** - work with friends on a shared zentangle
- **More drawing tools** - shapes, brush styles, or stickers
- **More shapes** - other templates to fill in besides grids and circles
